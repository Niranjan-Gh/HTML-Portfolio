    <h2>Game Designer/Artist</h2>
    
    <h3>Developed GDD, Mechanics, Assets, and  Level Design for the Game.</h3>

    <p>Train Jam is a puzzle game where players guide passengers to the correct train coaches by matching their colors. The concept was inspired by Bus Jam, and I reimagined it with an Indian train aesthetic to give it a unique and culturally rich feel.</p><br>
    
    <h3>Challenges Encounterd</h3>
    <p>One of the key challenges in this game was designing it to be colorful and appealing to children, while also implementing the A* pathfinding algorithm. Balancing visual creativity with technical problem-solving made the development process both engaging and rewarding. I particularly enjoyed creating the vibrant assets and bringing the game to life through code.</p>

    <h3>Result</h3>
    <p>Train Jam features multiple levels that progressively increase in difficulty, challenging players to solve increasingly complex puzzles. The core objective is to guide passengers each represented by different colors onto the corresponding train cars that match their color. This mechanic requires careful planning and quick thinking, making each level both engaging and rewarding as players strategize to successfully complete the puzzles.</p>
